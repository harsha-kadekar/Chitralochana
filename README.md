A tool to anayze tweets, fb posts and then plain texts

Initial plan is to analyze the tweets. Different types of analysis planned are - Sentiment analysis, hashtag relationship, geo-location analysis, tweet time frame analysis. Once this analysis is done, we will be representing that analysis in different visualizations. User will provide input in a web page, which will be passed to an engine which will do the analysis. Based on that analysis again in web page we will be displaying visualization.

I am hoping to extensively use Natrual Language processing for analysis of tweets. Then for visualization I am planning to use D3 javascript framework. Analysis engine will be written in python. As it involves web interface, I am planning to use DJango web development framwork. But I donot know anyting about web part. So still decision is not yet taken.

Once I am comfortable with the tweet analysis, next step if facebook and other social network analysis. Finally pure language analysis.
